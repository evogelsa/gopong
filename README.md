## GoPong

This was written alongside the Games With Go Pong tutorial created by Jack Mott.
I used this as a way to learn and experiment with Golang, and I have expanded
the Pong game to add some new features such as:
- 2 player mode
- Paddle edge detection
- Changing ball velocity
- Random start state
- Unpause screen
- Game pause with escape
 
 #### Controls
 
 Game:
 - ESC to pause
 - Space to unpause or resume
 - First to 10 points wins and the game automatically resets
 
 Player 1 (left paddle):
 - W/S to move paddle up or down
 
 Player 2 (right paddle):
 - Up/down arrow keys to move paddle up or down
 
 #### Planned features
 - 2 player or 1 player select screen
 - Win screen
 - Different AI difficulties
 
 #### Known bugs
 - Paddles can move off screen
